=============================
mixedvines Package for Python
=============================

Package for canonical vine copula trees with mixed continuous and discrete
marginals.  If you use this software for publication, please cite
[ONKEN2016]_.


Description
-----------

This package contains a complete framework based on canonical vine copulas for
modeling multivariate data that are partly discrete and partly continuous.
The resulting multivariate distributions are flexible with rich dependence
structures and marginals.

For continuous marginals, implementations of the normal and the gamma
distributions are provided.  For discrete marginals, Poisson, binomial and
negative binomial distributions are provided.  As bivariate copula building
blocks, the Gaussian, Frank and Clayton families as well as rotation
transformed families are provided.  Additional marginal and pair-copula
distributions can be added easily.

The package includes methods for sampling, likelihood calculation and
inference, all of which have quadratic complexity.  These procedures are
combined to estimate entropy by means of Monte Carlo integration.

Please see [ONKEN2016]_ for a more detailed description of the framework.


Documentation
-------------

The full documentation for the mixedvines package is available at
`Read the Docs
<http://mixedvines.readthedocs.io/>`_.


Requirements
------------

The package requires Python 3.10 or greater and additionally requires
`NumPy and SciPy
<http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_.


Installation
------------

To install the mixedvines package, run::

    pip install mixedvines


Usage
-----

Suppose that data are given in a NumPy array ``samples`` with shape
``(n, d)``, where ``n`` is the number of samples and ``d`` is the number of
elements per sample.  First, specify which of the elements are continuous.
If, for instance, the distribution has three elements and the first and last
elements are continuous whereas the second element is discrete:

.. code-block:: python

    is_continuous = [True, False, True]

To fit a mixed vine to the samples:

.. code-block:: python

    from mixedvines.mixedvine import MixedVine
    vine = MixedVine.fit(samples, is_continuous)

``vine`` is now a ``MixedVine`` object.  To draw samples from the
distribution, calculate their density and estimate the distribution entropy in
units of bits:

.. code-block:: python

    samples = vine.rvs(size=100)
    logpdf = vine.logpdf(samples)
    entropy, standard_error_mean = vine.entropy(sem_tol=1e-2)

To manually construct and visualize a simple mixed vine model:

.. code-block:: python

    from scipy.stats import norm, gamma, poisson
    import numpy as np
    from mixedvines.copula import GaussianCopula, ClaytonCopula, FrankCopula
    from mixedvines.mixedvine import MixedVine
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import itertools
    # Manually construct mixed vine
    dim = 3  # Dimension
    vine = MixedVine(dim)
    # Specify marginals
    vine.set_marginal(0, norm(0, 1))
    vine.set_marginal(1, poisson(5))
    vine.set_marginal(2, gamma(2, 0, 4))
    # Specify pair-copulas
    vine.set_copula(1, 0, GaussianCopula(0.5))
    vine.set_copula(1, 1, FrankCopula(4))
    vine.set_copula(2, 0, ClaytonCopula(5))
    # Calculate probability density function on lattice
    bnds = np.empty((3), dtype=object)
    bnds[0] = [-3, 3]
    bnds[1] = [0, 15]
    bnds[2] = [0.5, 25]
    x0, x1, x2 = np.mgrid[bnds[0][0]:bnds[0][1]:0.05, bnds[1][0]:bnds[1][1],
                          bnds[2][0]:bnds[2][1]:0.1]
    points = np.array([x0.ravel(), x1.ravel(), x2.ravel()]).T
    pdf = vine.pdf(points)
    pdf = np.reshape(pdf, x1.shape)
    # Generate random variates
    size = 100
    samples = vine.rvs(size)
    # Visualize 2d marginals and samples
    comb = list(itertools.combinations(range(dim), 2))
    for i, cmb in enumerate(comb):
        # Sum over all axes not in cmb
        cmb_inv = tuple(set(range(dim)) - set(cmb))
        margin = np.sum(pdf, axis=cmb_inv).T
        plt.subplot(2, len(comb), i + 1)
        plt.imshow(margin, aspect='auto', interpolation='none', cmap='hot',
                   origin='lower', extent=[bnds[cmb[0]][0], bnds[cmb[0]][1],
                                           bnds[cmb[1]][0], bnds[cmb[1]][1]])
        plt.ylabel('$x_' + str(cmb[1]) + '$')
        plt.subplot(2, len(comb), len(comb) + i + 1)
        plt.scatter(samples[:, cmb[0]], samples[:, cmb[1]], s=1)
        plt.xlim(bnds[cmb[0]][0], bnds[cmb[0]][1])
        plt.ylim(bnds[cmb[1]][0], bnds[cmb[1]][1])
        plt.xlabel('$x_' + str(cmb[0]) + '$')
        plt.ylabel('$x_' + str(cmb[1]) + '$')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

This code shows the 2d marginals and 100 samples of a 3d mixed vine.
