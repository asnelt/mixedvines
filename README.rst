mixedvines Package for Python
=============================

Package for canonical vine copula trees with mixed continuous and discrete
margins. If you use this package, then please cite:

Description
-----------

In this package, we will implement a complete framework based on canonical
vine copulas for modelling multivariate data that are partly discrete and
partly continuous. The resulting multivariate distributions will be
flexible with rich dependence structures and arbitrary margins.
